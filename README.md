## Contribute a Stylesheet

Visit the [files section](https://stylestage.dev/) to download the source files.

Or jump right in by [forking the CodePen](https://codepen.io/5t3ph/pen/b493845ae41e836889dd84fdbb0f5291).

Then, create your own version of the stylesheet, being sure to adhere to [the guidelines](https://stylestage.dev/guidelines/). Use it as a starting point, or begin from a blank file! Keep in mind you may not modify the HTML, including adding classes.

You may use any build setup you prefer, but the final submission should be the compiled CSS _unminified_. Style Stage processing will autoprefix your styles and prepend the stylesheet with the [CC BY-NC-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) as well as attribution using the metadata you provide.

To submit your stylesheet, create pull request containing a _unique_ `.json` file added to [\_src/\_data/styles/](https://github.com/5t3ph/stylestage/blob/main/src/_data/styles) following the schema below.

```json
{
  // Required
  "title": "Main Stage Test",
  "author": "Stephanie Eckles",
  "stylesheet": "https://moderncss.dev/css/style.css",
  // Optional
  "twitter": "5t3ph",
  "websiteTitle": "ModernCSS.dev",
  "websiteUrl": "https://moderncss.dev"
}
```
