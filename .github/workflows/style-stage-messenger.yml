            var msg = `ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for participating! I will review as soon as I am able. Please know that I have other priorities, and I appreciate your patience.

            **Watch for notifications** as I may request some small changes to make sure this meets the guidelines.

            In a few minutes, the Netlify process at the end of this PR will make a preview available. Look for the message "Deploy preview ready!" then click the "Details" link next to it to launch a preview of your styles. Make changes if needed, and comment if you do so I can re-deploy the preview. Note that the "sponsor footer" is not available to fully style, but you may fix any issues it causes to your layout.

            Thanks again, I hope you learned something while making your stylesheet! ðŸ’«`
